# Test DataEngineer Intermediate

## Implementation of ETL workflow

You will find the implementation of the ETL workflow inside the file [etl.py](https://github.com/ConanGuy/Fulll_DataEngineer_Intermediate/blob/master/etl.py).

## Explore the data using SQL

You will find the implementation of the SQL queries inside the folder [queries](https://github.com/ConanGuy/Fulll_DataEngineer_Intermediate/tree/master/queries).

## Deployment

As I'm not an expert about pipelines and coding environment, I prefer to skip this part. I think it will be more convenient to talk about my experiences and what I know about deployment directly during a future interview.
